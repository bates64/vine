VINE is roughly based on the 4th generation of consoles:

- 9-trit word size
- 243x243 display
- [9k work ram](memory.md)

#### who is it for?

VINE is intended for people who:

- Want to learn assembly language
- Are interested in trying balanced ternary in practice
- Like [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) but want to write assembly instead / don't want to spend $14.99

#### acknowledgments

- [The Ternary Manifesto][manifesto] of Douglas W. Jones
- Retro Game Mechanics Explained's [SNES Features series][snes-features]
- Donald Knuth - called balanced ternary "perhaps the prettiest number system of them all" in [TAOCP]
